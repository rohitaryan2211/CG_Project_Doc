We used this research paper where the authors present a solution to aliasing problem for shadow algorithms that uses depth maps.

We will be using Directional Lights as our main source of lightings in the scene and have a Crow model placed for our test subject.

We are using Depth Maps for implementing Shadow Maps in the scene. Shadow\+Map Program generates a Depth Map from light\textquotesingle{}s perspective and sends it to the camera for the models to cast shadows using \mbox{\hyperlink{class_shader}{Shader}} Program.

Here, we should see a Hardline Shadow formed by the parts of models to itself like the hat to its face, beak to its clothes and many more.

By implementing PCF, we apply a Kernel of some radius to average out the shadow value across the edge of the shadows and blending the edge.

We see a good result of soft shadows for radius of 3 and above but we notice significant performance issues for radius near 8 and above due to it\textquotesingle{}s computation needs.\hypertarget{index_team_sec}{}\doxysubsection{Team Members\+:}\label{index_team_sec}
